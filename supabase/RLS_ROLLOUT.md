# Supabase authentication and RLS rollout

This document is a **production migration plan**, not an automatically applied migration. The current AgentBreaker demo tables have RLS disabled so the public dashboard can read demo telemetry. Do not enable RLS until the dashboard has authenticated access and server-side write paths.

## Required schema changes

1. Add `workspace_id` or `company_id` to `agent_sessions`, `tool_execution_logs`, and `agent_alerts`.
2. Backfill existing demo rows to the demo workspace.
3. Add non-null constraints only after backfill succeeds.
4. Add indexes on each tenant key and session foreign key.

## Access model

- Dashboard reads use Supabase Auth JWTs.
- The Python SDK writes through a server-side ingestion endpoint or a tightly scoped customer API key.
- Never expose a service-role key in frontend code.
- Every query is scoped to the authenticated workspace.

## Policy shape

Policies should ensure:

```sql
workspace_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'workspace_id')::uuid
```

Use separate policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE`. Do not grant unrestricted `anon` access to detector tables.

## Rollout checklist

- [ ] Add tenant columns and backfill demo data.
- [ ] Add authenticated dashboard session handling.
- [ ] Add server-side ingestion endpoint.
- [ ] Add policy tests for cross-tenant reads and writes.
- [ ] Verify Slack actions are bound to a tenant-scoped session.
- [ ] Enable RLS in staging.
- [ ] Run the full dashboard and SDK integration suite.
- [ ] Enable RLS in production only after the above checks pass.

## Why this is not auto-applied

Enabling RLS without policies can make existing dashboard queries return no rows. Applying it to the live project without a confirmed tenant/auth design would be an unsafe access change.
